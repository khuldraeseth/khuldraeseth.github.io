title: About

I'm a college student in the American Midwest, studying computer science. Big fan of Haskell and baseball, and small fan of a great many other things.

Interesting that this About page is `about.rst` while pretty much everything else in the Hakyll template is markdown. I'll probably try to get this switched over once I learn a bit about how to use Hakyll.
