title: Getting Started

This first post is a test to make sure I'm doing things properly. I've never kept a blog before, let alone one using Hakyllâ€”with luck, this will work out well enough.

Thanks to qwertz for getting me to start this: ![The message on Discord that persuaded me to blog](/images/inspiration.png)

You can expect a lot of very silly Haskell stuff, assuming I put in the time to post now and then. I'm learning Haskell right now, and it's by far my favorite programming language. I'll likely draw comparisons to Python and C++, the other two languages with which I am most familiar, though this hopefully will change over time as I pick up more. Might also take a look at an esolang here and there or complain about a language I unfortunately had to touch.

I'm interested in more than just programming, of course. I love baseball and the Detroit Tigers, and I have a [player](http://probaseballexperience.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=9010) in a simulated baseball league; expect to hear about both. Could touch on human languages on occasion as I try to learn Anglo-Saxon or take the rust off my Latin, could go over things I find interesting as I go through college, could write about music, could post really anything that crosses my mind. I don't really have a plan for this blog, so let's see how it all unfolds.
