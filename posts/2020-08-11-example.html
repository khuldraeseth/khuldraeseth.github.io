<p>This first post is a test to make sure I’m doing things properly. I’ve never kept a blog before, let alone one using Hakyll—with luck, this will work out well enough.</p>
<p>Thanks to qwertz for getting me to start this: <img src="../images/inspiration.png" alt="The message on Discord that persuaded me to blog" /></p>
<p>You can expect a lot of very silly Haskell stuff, assuming I put in the time to post now and then. I’m learning Haskell right now, and it’s by far my favorite programming language. I’ll likely draw comparisons to Python and C++, the other two languages with which I am most familiar, though this hopefully will change over time as I pick up more. Might also take a look at an esolang here and there or complain about a language I unfortunately had to touch.</p>
<p>I’m interested in more than just programming, of course. I love baseball and the Detroit Tigers, and I have a <a href="http://probaseballexperience.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=9010">player</a> in a simulated baseball league; expect to hear about both. Could touch on human languages on occasion as I try to learn Anglo-Saxon or take the rust off my Latin, could go over things I find interesting as I go through college, could write about music, could post really anything that crosses my mind. I don’t really have a plan for this blog, so let’s see how it all unfolds.</p>
